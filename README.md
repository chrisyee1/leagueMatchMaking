# League Matchup Checker

The League Matchup Checker is a way for users to examine their match up in a current game. It uses data from the Riot API and Champion.gg API to get information on champion damage dealt, damage taken and other parts of the game to see what the user's champion will have to deal with in laning phase and in the game. In addition some stats will be shown that include ranks of participants and the mastery score of participants with the champ they are currently playing.
